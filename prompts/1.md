help me write a prompt to /extraction_prompt.md to improve the instructions for langextract in textExtraction.py

Review langextract docu first: https://github.com/google/langextract

The problem: 
We are building a software that is supposed to help architects with a mix of AI and good old UI-DRIVEN SEMANTIC DATA BASED software navigate the area of building laws, norms, regulations. We are starting with spain. In spain, these (I will refer to all of them as norms from now on)  are defined from state level to regional level to communal level. 
They are organized in badly structured free-text pdf files with hundreds of hundreds of pages. A mix of tables, maps, alot of text. And also a couple hundred pdf files.
Currently Architects need to find those files, depending on where they want to build and what they want to build, and then spend hours or days finding the right norm or article inside that, which might maybe apply to their project. It's a very cumbersome process. When they want to hand in their project request to the city hall, they have to declare first all the norms that would apply to what they are intending to do, and then, wether they are conform with for their works (self declaration). 

Our desired solution: We want to process all these documents, understand the semantics inside them, understand how to organize, filter, reduce, apply the norms to offer architects a easy UI that asks you a couple of questions (e.g. Are you working on a new building or a reform? Do you plan to change the structure? Does your work include works on the heating system?) and by collecting those answers massively reduce the amount of norms the architect has to review, thus, offering a easier access to the the right norms and than a UI that helps with the self-declaration process (e.g. YES, My project conforms with the emergency reuglation ER-999; or YES, we have only built 2 floors in this zone R9.2 where only 2 are allowed at max.).

To be able to do this we have thought of a system that
- processes the documents into norm entities
- categorizes and tags the norms into a logical relationship (e.g. FURNITURE.TABLE.TABLELEG; OR HOUSE.GATE.DOOR.AUTOMATIC)
- it is imperative to build a hierarchy of these relationships via topic so we dont end up having a infinite list of atomic tags and norms, in that case, we couldnt filter 
- we have also to process the text related to a norm or tag for the following:
-- matching criteria When does this norm apply?
-- exclusion criteria Under which circumstances does it not apply?
-- satisfaction criteria: When have I complied with this norm? (e.g. x < 20, or String is of [Green, Red, Yellow])
-- for whom is this norm relevant? And for what type of project? (could be tags as well)
-- Additionally, if its a tag higher up in the hierarchy (node wise), we need to generate a meaningful questionare to be able to derive information from this to further filter down a rather big category or tag gorup
-- Also, we need to know, if it specifies that if it applies a form has to be annexed and filled or if a specific statement has to be made, as in that case, we want to also integrate that into our solution automatically (need to understand types of consequences and relationships)
- For the criteria logic we are thinking to build a custom query language that we teach langextract, that supports simple comparision operators <= < > >= || && == and IN[] for types STRING, STRING[] AND NUMBER.
- Ideally the strings in the querylanguage are not sentences or freetext but again a consice precise created list of tags, parameters, arguments, that as langextract keeps extracting tries to make hierarchical relationship into (as mentionedd above)

Additionally, since this entire construct of which norm applies when, is HEAVILY dependent on location, we need to understand any location based relationships or criteria towards the norm. In its most simple form, its STATE>REGION>COMMUNE but sometimes Communes define "planning zones" that dont follow a clear pattern (e.g. R6.2, S1, PEM2) that are valid for some part of their city/village. It's imperative to capture those as well in a organized manner and being able to put them as well into relationship with each other.



Help me design a prompt for an agent that then in turn will incorporate these aspects into testExtraction.py

Please ask me questions for clarification as they make sense before you end with your result. Also, think deeply, this is mission critical.
