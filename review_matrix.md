I will perform a web fetch of the upstream GitHub repository README to gather context (public docs). ## Review Summary and Recommendations

You asked for a review of the upstream `google/langextract` repository versus your enhanced local runner testExtraction_3.py and for further recommendations. Below is a structured gap analysis and prioritized action plan.

---

### 1. Current Strengths of testExtraction_3.py
- Rich multi-entity schema (Norms, Tags, Locations, Questions, Consequences, Parameters) surpasses basic upstream usage patterns.
- Teach mode layering: prompt appendix + entity semantics + dynamic glossary injection.
- Post-generation enrichment pipeline: parameter mining, duplicate tag merge, cross-ref repair, relationship inference, metrics.
- Auto question phrasing ensures all questions are usable; warnings preserve provenance.
- Extended metrics (reuse, alignment, consequence linkage, location propagation) support semantic quality tracking.

### 2. Gaps vs Upstream Capabilities & Best Practices
| Area | Upstream Expectation / Best Practice | Current State | Gap |
|------|--------------------------------------|---------------|-----|
| Visualization & JSONL workflow | Use `lx.io.save_annotated_documents` + `visualize` | Writes single rich JSON only | Missing standardized JSONL + viz generation |
| Multi-pass extraction (`extraction_passes`) | Improves recall on long texts | Single pass | Lack of iterative recall tuning |
| Chunking/parallelism | Upstream supports doc URL ingestion & parallel workers | Runner hardcodes single string | Not leveraging built-in scaling features |
| Schema constraints/fenced output | Some providers benefit from fencing | Set `fence_output=False` universally | Not adapting per provider (OpenAI needs fence) |
| DSL validation | Only heuristic regex | No AST / error localization | Potential silent logical errors |
| Testing harness | Upstream uses pytest and CI | Runner manual; no regression tests | Lacks automated guardrails |
| Provider abstraction | Upstream: pluggable providers | Hardcoded Gemini ID | No fallback/ensemble logic |
| Ontology persistence | Not covered upstream but implied by your goals | In-memory only | No cross-run ID continuity/versioning |
| Provenance & span mapping | Upstream maps char spans per extraction | Your Norm objects lack source spans in rich path | Some provenance fields unpopulated |
| Confidence calibration | Upstream defers to model & schema | Heuristic additions only | No calibration model or scoring consistency |
| Error stratification | Upstream: clear errors vs warnings | Mixed warnings list (metrics, placeholders) | Needs categorization + severity levels |
| Documentation | Upstream has docs site | Local prompt + appendices | Missing developer README for semantics runtime |

### 3. Prioritized Recommendations (Actionable)

#### Tier 1 (Foundational)
1. Add DSL Parser & Validator
   - Implement tokenizer -> Pratt parser (precedence: NOT > AND > OR; handle `; OR` alt groups separately).
   - Produce structured AST nodes (Comparison, InList, LogicalOp, AltGroup).
   - Emit error objects with span indices and classification (SYNTAX_ERROR, UNKNOWN_FIELD, UNSUPPORTED_OPERATOR).
   - Gate enrichment on zero critical DSL errors.

2. Introduce JSONL Output + Visualization
   - Serialize each Norm / Tag / etc. as separate annotated doc or embed original rich object but still produce `extraction_results.jsonl`.
   - Call `lx.visualize` when `LX_VISUALIZE=1`.

3. Multi-Pass & Adaptive Recall
   - Parameterize `extraction_passes` (e.g., env `LX_PASSES`).
   - After pass 1: collect unresolved field paths / uncovered normative sentences and inject as “focus hints” into pass 2 prompt tail.

4. Provenance Completion
   - Update Norm structures to include `source.span_char_start`, `source.span_char_end` using substring search or char offset scanning.
   - Add optional fuzzy fallback if duplicate sentences.

#### Tier 2 (Quality & Scaling)
5. Ontology Persistence Layer
   - Create `ontology_state.json` with running counters & a map `tag_path -> tag_id`, `annex_code -> consequence_id`.
   - On run start: load; on completion: merge & flush.
   - Enforce stable IDs across runs.

6. Structured Metrics Categories
   - Replace warnings array with: `quality = { errors: [...], warnings: [...], info: [...], metrics: { ... } }`.
   - Move METRICS/EXT_METRICS strings into a dict; reserve warnings for actionable anomalies.

7. Parameter Normalization Enrichment
   - Add unit canonicalization mapping (N → NEWTON, PERSONAS → PERSONS) with reversible `display_unit`.
   - Detect conflicting duplicates (same field_path + operator + distinct values across alternative groups) -> mark as `scope_variant: true`.

8. Confidence Calibration Heuristic
   - Score Norm confidence = base (0.7) + 0.05 * linked_parameters - 0.05 * unresolved_tags - 0.1 * placeholder_tags_used (clamped 0–0.95).
   - Add explanation array: `confidence_rationale`.

9. Test Suite
   - Add pytest module `tests/rich_runner_test.py`:
     - Test: all Questions have `question_text`.
     - Test: no placeholder tag left without definition after manual override.
     - Test: DSL parse roundtrip for sample expressions (serialize back to normalized string).
     - Test: relationship inference (Annex linking) triggers as expected.

#### Tier 3 (Advanced)
10. Coverage Estimator
    - Norm candidate detector: sentences with modal verbs or thresholds.
    - Compute recall estimate: extracted_norms / candidate_sentences.

11. Priority Auto-Assignment
    - Heuristic table: PROHIBITION > MANDATORY > RECOMMENDATION > OPTIONAL; thresholds / safety terms bump priority.
    - Add override via explicit pattern list in config JSON.

12. FAQ / Ontology Documentation Generator
    - Export markdown summarizing each Tag, linked Questions, parameter frequency.

13. Error Budget & Exit Codes
    - If CRITICAL errors > 0, exit non-zero (for CI gating).
    - Provide summary block at end with counts.

14. Provider Strategy
    - Add environment variable to choose provider chain (e.g., Gemini primary, fallback to local Ollama for second pass consistency cross-check).
    - Compute divergence metrics between providers for stability assessment.

### 4. Suggested Code Insertions / Integration Points
- DSL Parser: new module `langextract/dsl_parser.py`; import in runner; integrate in validation step before enrichment.
- Ontology Persistence: small utility `ontology_store.py` storing JSON; load early, update late.
- Metrics Restructure: modify `apply_enrichment_pipeline` to build a dict instead of string warnings.
- Visualization & JSONL: after enrichment, call:
  ```python
  from langextract import io as lxio
  lxio.save_annotated_documents([result], output_name=\"rich_extractions.jsonl\", output_dir=\".\")
  ```
- Test scaffolding: rely on existing pyproject.toml test extras; add new test file.

### 6. Minimal Immediate Patch Set (if you want next)
If you’d like me to start implementing right away, I recommend in first batch:
1. Metrics restructuring
2. JSONL + visualization option
3. Confidence calibration
4. Placeholder ontology persistence scaffold

Let me know and I’ll proceed.

### 7. Quick Win Snippet (Confidence Calibration Example)
Example integration stub (ready for later insertion):
```python
def calibrate_norm_confidence(norm: dict) -> None:
    base = 0.7
    boost = 0.05 * len(norm.get(\"extracted_parameters_ids\", []) or [])
    penalties = 0.0
    if norm.get(\"notes\") == \"Legacy fallback\":
        penalties += 0.2
    if any(t.startswith(\"PLACEHOLDER_TAG_CREATED\") for t in norm.get(\"_anomalies\", [])):
        penalties += 0.05
    norm[\"confidence\"] = max(0.05, min(0.95, base + boost - penalties))
```

---

### 8. Summary
Your runner already extends core LangExtract usage into a domain-specific extraction framework with semantic teaching and post-processing logic. The biggest remaining levers are: formal DSL validation, persistent ontology identity management, moving ad-hoc strings into structured metrics, and introducing tests + multi-pass recall improvements.

Want me to begin implementing the Tier 1 items now? Just say the word (and optionally prioritize within Tier 1), and I’ll execute the changes incrementally with validation.
